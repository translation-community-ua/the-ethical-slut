Dossie and Janet have authored several other books, available from Greenery Press:

_When Someone You Love Is Kinky_ is for the friends, family, coworkers, and partners of anyone who’s involved in an alternative sexuality like S/M, D/S, leather, cross-dressing, or fetish. (Note: Janet wrote this book under her former pen name, Catherine A. Liszt.)

_The New Bottoming Book_ and _The New Topping Book_ show how to bring all your power, sexiness, and smarts to your role as a BDSM bottom or top.

_Radical Ecstasy: SM Journeys to Transcendence_ chronicles Dossie and Janet’s individual and mutual experiences with altered states of consciousness during BDSM play and offers some ideas drawn from tantra and other practices about how to journey there yourself.

Janet is also the author of _The Sexually Dominant Woman_ (written as “Lady Green”), _Spanking for Lovers_, and (with Dr. Charles Moser) _Sex Disasters…And How to Survive Them_, as well as a memoir, _Girlfag: A Life Told in Sex and Musicals_ (Beyond Binary Press).

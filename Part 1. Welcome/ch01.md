# 1 Хто така етична блядь?

Багато людей мріють про достаток любові і **сексу** і дружби. Деякі вважають, що таке життя неможливе і погоджуються на менше, ніж хочуть, відчуваючи себе завжди трохи самотніми, трохи розчарованими. Інші намагаються досягти своєї мрії, але їм заважає зовнішній соціальний тиск або власні емоції, і вони вирішують, що такі мрії повинні залишатися у сфері фантазії. Дехто, однак, наполягає на цьому і виявляє, що бути відкрито люблячим, інтимним і сексуальним з багатьма людьми не тільки можливо, але й може бути більш корисним, ніж вони могли собі уявити.

Люди досягали успіху у вільному коханні протягом багатьох століть — часто тихо, без особливої помпезності. У цій книзі ми поділимося техніками, навичками та ідеалами, які змусили їх працювати.

Так хто ж така етична **блядь**? Це Ми, а також багато-багато інших людей. Можливо, ви теж. Якщо ви мрієте про свободу, якщо ви мрієте про інтимну близькість — як гарячу, так і глибоку, якщо ви мрієте про велику кількість друзів, флірт і прихильність, про те, щоб слідувати своїм бажанням і бачити, куди вони вас приведуть, то ви вже зробили перший крок відкривши цю книгу.

## Чому ми обрали таку назву?

З того моменту, як ви побачили або почули про цю книгу, ви, мабуть, здогадалися, що деякі терміни тут можуть мати не те значення, до якого ви звикли.

Які люди будуть із задоволенням називати себе бляддю? І чому вони наполягають на визнанні своєї етики?

У більшості країн світу  _блядь_  є дуже образливим терміном, який використовується для опису жінки, чия сексуальність є ненажерливою, невибірковою та ганебною. IЦікаво відзначити, що аналогічні слова _жеребець_ or _кобель_, які використовуються для опису надзвичайно сексуального чоловіка, часто є термінами, які показують схвалення та гордості. Якщо ви запитаєте про чоловічу мораль, то ви, скоріше за все почуєте про її чесність, вірність, і високі принципи. Коли ви запитаєте щось про жіночу мораль то ви імовірно, почуєте про те, з ким вона займається сексом і за яких умов. У нас із цим проблема.

Тому ми пишаємося тим, що  **переписуємо** слово _блядь_ як термін схвалення, навіть ніжності. Для нас блядь - це людина будь-якого **гендеру** ,  яка прославляє сексуальність згідно з радикальним положенням про те, що секс – це приємно, а задоволення – це добре. Бляді можуть взагалі не займатися сексом або переспати з усією Третьою штурмовою бригадою [^1] . Вони можуть бути гетеросексуалами, гомосексуалами, **асексуалами**, або бісексуалами, радикальними активістами чи мирними жителями передмістя.

Як горді бляді, ми віримо, що секс і сексуальне кохання є основними силами добра; є тією діяльністю, яка потенційно може зміцнити інтимні зв’язки, покращити життя, відкрити духовне усвідомлення та навіть змінити світ. Крім того, ми віримо, що всі інтимні стосунки за згодою мають ці можливості, і що будь-який еротичний шлях, якщо він обраний свідомо, і ним ідуть усвідомлено, може бути позитивною, творчою силою в житті окремих людей та їхніх спільнот.

Бляді діляться своєю сексуальністю так само, як філантропи діляться своїми грошима: тому що вони мають чимало, щоб поділитися, тому що їм приємно ділитися ними, тому що розділення із іншими робить світ кращим. Бляді часто виявляють, що чим більше любові та сексу вони віддають, тим більше вони мають: це те саме диво, у якому жадібність і щедрість йдуть рука об руку, щоб забезпечити більше для всіх. Уявіть собі життя в сексуальному достатку!

## About You

Maybe you dream of maintaining several long-term sexual and intimate relationships. Maybe your dream is of a lot of friendships that may or may not include sex. Maybe the idea of genital sex holds no interest for you but you still want to form a warm, loving partnership…or two or three. Maybe you want monogamy but a kind of monogamy that you and your partner have created according to your own desires and not the blueprint handed down by the greater culture. Maybe you want to be single, connecting where and how you want without changing your fundamental independence. Maybe you want to be part of a couple that occasionally shares a bed with a mutually desirable third party or that takes a planned night away from monogamy every now and then. Maybe you dream of three-way or four-way or orgiastic connections. Maybe you cherish solitude and want to find ways to get your needs met all by yourself with the occasional help of a friend or lover.

Or maybe you want to explore different paths, to try a few things to see how they feel, to see how many kinds of relating you can fit into your busy and interesting life.

All these possibilities and a hundred more are legitimate ways of being an ethical slut. As you read this book, you’ll find that some of our ideas will be good fits for the way you want to live and others will not. Take what you want and leave the rest. As long as you and the people you care about are consenting, growing, and taking good care of yourselves and the people around you, you’re doing ethical sluthood right, so don’t let someone else’s opinions—including ours—tell you otherwise.

## About Us

Between us, we represent a fairly large slice of the pie that is sexual diversity.

Dossie is a therapist in private practice in San Francisco, specializing in alternative sexualities, nontraditional relationships, and therapy for trauma survivors. She has identified as **queer** for more than thirty years, informed by the women’s and the gay men’s communities and by her years of bisexuality before that. She committed to an open sexual lifestyle in 1969 when her daughter was a newborn and taught her first workshop on unlearning jealousy in 1973. She has spent about half of her adult life living single, sort of, with families of housemates, lovers, and other intimates. She makes her home in the mountains north of San Francisco.

Many of you may remember Janet from the first edition of this book as Catherine A. Liszt, a pen name she used back when her sons were still minors. Now that they’re grown and independent, she has gone back to using her real name. Janet lived as a teenaged slut in college but then essayed traditional monogamy in a heterosexual marriage for more than a decade. Since the end of that marriage, she has not considered monogamy an option for her. While most people would call her bisexual, she thinks of herself as gender-bent and can’t quite figure out how sexual **orientation** is supposed to work when you’re sometimes male and sometimes female. She’s married to a bio-guy whose gender is as flexible as hers, which is less complicated than it sounds. She makes her living as a writer, publisher, and teacher, and lives in Eugene, Oregon.

Together, we have been lovers, dear friends, coauthors, and coconspirators for a quarter century, in and out of various other relationships, homes, and projects. We are both parents of grown children, both active in the **BDSM**/**leather**/**kink** communities, and both creative writers. We think we’re a great example of what can happen if you don’t try to force all your relationships into the monogamous ’til-death-do-us-part model.

## Sexual Adventurers

The world generally views sluts as debased, degraded, promiscuous, indiscriminate, jaded, immoral adventurers—destructive, out of control, and driven by some form of psychopathology that prevents them from entering into a healthy monogamous relationship.

Oh, yes—and definitely not ethical.

We see ourselves as people who are committed to finding a place of sanity with sex and relationships, and to freeing ourselves to enjoy sex and sexual love in as many ways as may fit for each of us. We may not always know what fits without trying it on, so we tend to be curious and adventurous. When we see someone who intrigues us, we like to feel free to respond, and, as we explore our response, to discover whatever is special about this new, fascinating person. We like relating to different kinds of people and reveling in how our differences expand our horizons and offer us new ways to be ourselves.

Sluts are not necessarily sexual athletes—although many of us do train more than most. Most of us value sex, not as a way to set records but for the pleasure it brings us and the good times we get to share with however many wonderful people.

We love adventure. The word _adventurer_ is sometimes used pejoratively, suggesting that the adventurous person is immature or inauthentic, not really willing to “grow up” and “settle down” into a presumably monogamous lifestyle. We wonder: What’s wrong with having adventures? Can’t we have adventures and still raise children, buy houses, and do the work that’s important to us? Of course we can; sluts qualify for mortgages just like everybody else. We tend to like our lives complicated, and the challenge of maintaining stable work and home lives while discovering new people and ideas is just what we need to keep us interested and engaged.

“We hate boredom. We are people who are greedy to experience all that life has to offer and are also generous in sharing what we have to offer.”

One of the most valuable things we learn from open sexual lifestyles is that our programming about love, intimacy, and sex can be rewritten. When we begin to question all the ways we have been told we ought to be, we can begin to edit and rewrite our old tapes. By breaking the rules, we both free and empower ourselves.

We hate boredom. We are people who are greedy to experience all that life has to offer and are also generous in sharing what we have to offer. We love to be the good time had by all.

## What’s New in This Edition

In the eight years since the previous edition of _The Ethical Slut_ was published, **polyamory** has become hugely more visible, which means that a very wide variety of people of all races, genders, orientations, and backgrounds are becoming interested in exploring the possibilities of relationships beyond culturally compelled monogamy. In this edition, we have done our best to speak to as wide a range of potential readers as we can. Hence, you’ll find that we’ve given more attention to people of color, asexual and aromantic people, people in their teens and early twenties, people of nonbinary gender, and other groups that too often receive short shrift from **sex-positive** communities.

A long-overdue conversation about the nature and nuance of sexual consent has also moved into the forefront of the cultural dialogue. We’ve included a new chapter on this important topic. And, just for fun, we’ve also added some short histories of the people and ideas that have helped make alternative sexuality what it is today.

## The Language in This Book

When you sit down to write a book about sex, as we hope you one day will, you will discover that centuries of censorship have left us with very little adequate language with which to discuss the joys and occasional worries of sex. The language that we do have often carries implicit judgments: If the only polite way to talk about sexuality is in medical Latin—_vulvas_ and _pudendas_, _penes_ and _testes_ —are only doctors allowed to talk about sex? Is sex all about disease? Meanwhile, most of the originally English words—_cock_ and _cunt_, _fucking_, and, oh yes, _slut_ —often have a hostile or coarse feel to them and are used as insults to degrade people and their sexuality. Euphemisms—_peepees_ and _pussies_, _jade gates_ and _mighty towers_ —sound as if we are embarrassed. Maybe we are.

Our approach to a sex-positive language is to reclaim the original English words and, by using them as positive descriptors, wash them clean. Hence our adoption of the word _slut_ (which we are proud to say has infiltrated the language in the form of **slut walks** and the rejection of **slut-shaming**). You will also find in this book words like **fuck** and cock and cunt used, not as insults, but to mean what they actually mean.

We are writing this book from a sex-positive position, in the belief that we are working for a healthier and happier and _safer_ world. We are aware, also, that for many people, sex has not been a positive thing in their lives, whether from cultural or religious shaming or from exposure to sexual violence, and sometimes because for them genital sex is not what they want.

Our fondest utopian visions are that when sex and love and intimacy are truly free, and seen as positive forces in our lives and in the world, we will be much more able to solve the problems of rape, sexual bullying, shaming, and repression. Indeed, we hope this book contributes to a world where you won’t settle for anything less than love and freedom in your sex life.

Cultural blind spots can show up as **centrisms**: couple-centrism, heterocentrism, eurocentrism. Nonmonogamy, extramarital sex, and **open relationships** all define themselves by what they _aren’t_, thus implying that they’re some exception to the “normal” relationships that “normal” people have.

_Polyamory_ was coined in 1992 and is currently, we are thrilled to report, included in the _Oxford English Dictionary_. Formed from Latin and Greek roots that translate as “loving many,” this word has been adopted by many sluts to describe their lifestyles. It is often abbreviated as _poly_, as in “I am a poly person.” Some use it to mean multiple committed live-in relationships, forms of group marriage; others use it as an umbrella word to cover all forms of sex and love and domesticity outside conventional monogamy. The word _polyamory_ has moved into the language so rapidly that we think maybe the language has been waiting for it for a very long time.

In this new world of sex and relationships, new terms get coined all the time to describe, or attempt to describe, the ever-changing spectrum of ways in which people arrange their lives. If, as you’re reading, you encounter a term you don’t understand, please check the Glossary in the back of the book, where we’ve defined many of these terms for you. The first usage of each Glossary term is marked **like this**.

People often ask us why we talk so much about sex. We see sex as the elephant in the room: huge, taking up lots of space, and too seldom included in the discourse about relationships. In this book we will talk about many kinds of love and we’ll also talk about sexual expression of all of them.

Finally, we are doing our best to make the language in this book as **pansexual** and gender-neutral as we can: this book is for everybody. In previous editions, we switched back and forth between “he” and “she” pronouns, but in this edition, with the newly increased visibility of nonbinary lifestyles and genders, we will use the gender-neutral pronouns **they**, **them**, and **their** whenever possible. _Pansexual_ means including everyone as a sexual being: straight, bi, lesbian, gay, asexual, nonbinary, **trans**, queer, old, young, disabled, pervert, male, female, questioning, transitioning. The examples and quotations in this book have been drawn from throughout the huge array of lifestyles we have encountered in our combined eight decades of sluthood: there are infinite “right” ways to be sexual, and we want to affirm all of them.

## Poly Pioneers: Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey Institute

Throughout this book, we’ll suggest that consensual behaviors like nonmarital sex, masturbation, homosexuality, and BDSM, still considered “sinful” and “perverted” by some, can in fact be life-enhancing and quite unexceptional ways to conduct an ethically slutty lifestyle. And if you’re not shocked to read that, you can thank Dr. Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues.

Kinsey, an Eagle Scout raised in a repressively patriarchal household, rebelled by studying insect biology rather than pursuing the engineering career dictated by his hyperreligious and autocratic father. Before he’d written a word about human sex, he was considered one of the world’s leading experts on the gall wasp, and had written two well-received monographs on the topic as well as several other texts on biology and nature.

Kinsey’s investigation into American sexual practices began when he was asked to team-teach a class on human sexuality at Indiana University. His interest was piqued when he found himself unable to answer student questions: scientific research on how people actually had sex simply didn’t exist. At about this time, the socially maladroit Kinsey began a more personal experiment: he met, fell in love with, and married the bright and tomboyish Clara McMillan (“Mac”), a graduate student in chemistry. Both Prok (a lifelong nickname, granted by his students, short for “Professor K”) and Mac were virgins at the time of their marriage, as many young couples were at the time; their difficulties in overcoming this inexperience were an additional spur to Kinsey’s determination to learn more about sex.

The completist spirit that had spurred Kinsey to collect tens of thousands of gall wasp specimens led him to spearhead an epic project: interviewing thousands of Americans of all genders, races, and classes about their sexual experiences and attitudes. He found enough sponsorship money that he was able to hire and train colleagues, who would go on to be respected sex researchers in their own right, to assist in this enormous task.

All in all, they collected more than twelve thousand enormously detailed sex histories, eight thousand from interviews by Kinsey himself. Kinsey reached out to people in lifestyles that are rarely public: minority communities, churches, small town PTAs, and many more. He campaigned for one 100 percent participation in many of these communities, to be certain that he wasn’t leaving out people who might be too shy or embarrassed to volunteer. Kinsey’s research and his conclusions are still well regarded even though statistical techniques are much more sophisticated today. All subsequent research owes a huge debt to the work of Kinsey and his team.

This cadre of researchers and their partners would be considered, in today’s terminology, a **_polycule_** or constellation. When sex is discussed openly, people typically feel much freer to act on their desires—so, unsurprisingly, both Prok and Mac were sexually involved with several of the researchers, who in turn had sex with one another’s spouses. Whatever difficulties were encountered in this arrangement—and there were several—seem to have had at least as much to do with the problem of being sexual with coworkers as they did with sexual jealousy. Kinsey’s frequently insensitive personal style was undoubtedly a factor as well. In spite of such small flare-ups, the Kinseyites remained colleagues and occasional lovers until Kinsey’s death in 1956, and members of the original crew continued at the helm of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction until 1982.

Even today, more than half a century after Kinsey’s death, he is a controversial figure. His books _Sexual Behavior in the Human Male_ (1948) and _Sexual Behavior in the Human Female_ (1953) sold hundreds of thousands of copies and created shock waves throughout the world when his collected interviews and statistics revealed the frequency of sexual activities like masturbation, extramarital sex, and same-sex connections in both men and women.

However, this important work fell subject to the Communist witch hunts of the 1950s, which cost him his funding and his health. Still today, those who oppose our contemporary sexual freedoms cite Kinsey’s bisexuality, nonmonogamy, kink interests, and nonjudgmentalism about his interview subjects as reasons to discount his groundbreaking research.

However, the genie of sexual knowledge cannot be easily crammed back into its bottle: today’s liberated sexual mores, including the acceptance of sex before or outside marriage, homosexuality and bisexuality, BDSM, and, yes, poly, owe their existence to Dr. Kinsey’s work. Prok, Mac, and the Kinseyites are clearly among the patron saints of ethical sluthood—not just for their pioneering sex and relationship constellations, but for the work they did to bring the true variety of human sexual experience into the light.
